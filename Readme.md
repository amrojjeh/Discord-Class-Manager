# Discord Class Manager
Due to the corona virus, my high school decided to make the switch to online schooling until April 13.
So to compensate, I made a Discord class server so that the students could at least keep an ongoing interaction.

## Crappy Code
Yes, the code crappy, and yes, I did spend a night on it to just get it work.
I originally just intended the bot to make text-channels for each period and class, and make them private to those who join them. Nothing else.
However, if this gets enough attention, I might re-write it and add support for things such as Canvas or remind for example. But since I don't intend to do that currently, the code will remain as it is, crappy and in a single file.

Feel free to fork it though!


## Usage
If you're the owner of the server, here's how you add teachers:
!add TEACHER

If you want to remove a category:
!remove CATEGORY

Note that there isn't a function to remove a teacher, I didn't bother writing it since I'll probably never be removing teachers. But for testing I needed to remove categories, so there's that. Though it won't remove the roles created.

If you want to join a class:
!join TEACHER [PERIOD]

Ex: !join Mark p4

## Good luck!
Even though my school has made the swtich to online, that doesn't mean the situation here is bad, just means that we're preventing it from becoming so. If you're being affected by the corona virus, then I wish you luck and good fortune.
